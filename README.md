# data_viz_shiny_app

This repository contains a Shiny app hosted at https://jfneum.shinyapps.io/data_viz_shiny_app/

The app requires a csv file containing at least the columns "Symbol" (HGNC genes), "adj.p.value" and "logFC"

The app can be deployed through Docker, however, actual painless GUI support is a work in progress.
